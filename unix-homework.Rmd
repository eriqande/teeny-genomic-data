Please submit code answers in the fenced `bash` code blocks below
each question/request below.  Other answers (that are not in written code to be evaluated)
just go in the plain old fenced text block under the question.

When you are done, make sure that all code chunks are evaluated from
a clean environment (Run -> Run All)
and then Preview the document to make a clean .nb.html output file.
That is what I will look at as your submission, so check it to make sure it
looks right.

Remember, every new fenced code block is going to start running in a shell
in the project directory, so if you need to change to a new directory, you
need to put that `cd` command in there.

Finally, there is not TAB completion for bash in the fenced `bash` code blocks.
So, you probably want to develop your command lines in the terminal window.

I provide an answer for questions 1 and 2 as examples of what we are looking for.


# `cd` to your home directory and print its path

```{bash}
cd ~
pwd
```

# Use echo to print `my name is ----` to stdout.  Where `----` is replaced by your name

```{bash}
echo "my name is Eric"
```


# now, really, answer the above question as yourself

```{bash}

```

# print the absolute path of the top level of the homework directory where this is

```{bash}

```

# list, in long format, all the files and directories in this homework directory

```{bash}

```

Note that some of the file names might look garbled in the Rmarkdown output.  This
is a consequency of RMarkdown/html not playing well with the shell's way of
colorizing `ls` output.

# There is a directory called `.git` in here that didn't get listed. List everything again, but make sure `.git` is in the output

```{bash}

```

# What are the other hidden files/directories that show up in the above listing? Just list them in the fenced text block below

```

```

# List (long format) the contents of the directory `.git`

```{bash}

```

# if you wanted to type `ls fastq/DPCh_plate1_A06_S6.R1.fq.gz` on the command line, what is the fewest keystrokes that can get you `fastq/DPCh_plate1_A06_S6.R1.fq.gz` using TAB completion?

I did it in 10 (counting TABs)...

```

```

# make a new directory called `lonely-fastqs`, and inside of that, two directories R1 and R2

```{bash}

```

# Copy (not move) all the read1 (`R1`) fastq files in `fastqs` into `lonely-fastqs/R1` and all the read2 fastqs into `lonely-fastqs/R2`. When you are done, on the next line in the code block, list the contents of `lonely-fastqs/R1` and `lonely-fastqs/R2`

```{bash}

```

# do a recursive, short listing of the contents of `lonely-fastqs`

```{bash}

```

# Use the recursive (-r) option to remove `lonely-fastqs` and its contents

```{bash}

```

# Make two new directories in the top level of the repo called `fq_AB` and `fq_notAB`

```{bash}

```

If you get an error because you already created those directories, that is OK
directories are there, it's all good...

# Using the `[` `]` copy the R1 files in `fastqs` that belong to sample names (the part immediately after `DPCh_plate1_`) starting with an `A` or `B` to `fq_AB`.  

```{bash}

```

# Now, using negation (`^`) with `[` and `]` copy all the R1 files that don't belong to sample names starting with an `A` or a `B` to `fq_notAB`. When you are done, on the next line in the code block, list the contents of `fq_AB` and `fq_notAB`. 

```{bash}

```

# Remove `fq_AB` and `fq_notAB`, and their contents

```{bash}

```

# Using the `{,}` construct create five directories named `dir_A`, `dir_C`, `dir_E`, `dir_G`, and `dir_I`, and list them (but not their contents) when you are done

```{bash}

```

# Using globbing, remove `dir_A`, `dir_C`, `dir_E`, `dir_G`, and `dir_I`, using a command with 8 characters (including spaces)

```{bash}

```

# Create a directory called `nice_dir_name` and then use `echo`, redirecting its output to create a file called `nice_file_name` inside of `nice_dir_name` whose contents is the string `A string in a file!`

```{bash}

```

# Catenate the contents of `nice_dir_name/nice_file_name` to _stdout_

```{bash}

```

# Create a directory called `bad directory name with spaces`, and then, with redirection, create a file inside it, named `bad file name with spaces` whose contents are the string `Whoa! No spaces, please!`.  Use backslash escaping instead of quoting

```{bash}

```

# Catenate the contents of `bad directory name with spaces/bad file name with spaces`

```{bash}

```

# list the directories (just the names, not the contents (`-d`)) `bad directory name with spaces` and `nice_dir_name`.

```{bash}

```

# Once you are convinced that you can list the directories correctly in your terminal, recall that `ls` command and replace `ls` with `rm -r` to remove them

```{bash}

```

# Why is it a good idea to `ls` things before removing them?

```

```

# If you had just typed `rm -r bad directory name with spaces` what would Unix have tried to remove?

```

```

# There are bam, sam, and fastq files, in the appropriately named directories for sample `A05_S5`. Make a directory named `A05_S5` and copy all those files into that new directory.  List the directory when you are done.

```{bash}

```

# remove the directory `A05_S5` and its contents

```{bash}

```

# Use `ls` to try to list the file `it_aint_here`

```{bash}

```

# Now, do the same thing but redirect _stderr_ into a file called `my_bad.txt`, and then catenate the contents of that file, and then remove it

```{bash}

```

# The files in `fastq` are text files, but they are all gzipped.  Using `gzcat` and a pipe, view the first 8 lines of `fastq/DPCh_plate1_C11_S35.R1.fq.gz`

```{bash}

```

# Do the same to see the first 8 lines of `fastq/DPCh_plate1_C11_S35.R2.fq.gz`

```{bash}

```

# What do you notice about the names of the two reads in each file (Lines 1 and 5, that start with a `@`)

```

```


# Print the date, redirect it to a file called `now.txt`, catenate that file to _stdout_ and then remove it

```{bash}

```

# Count the number of lines/words/characters (using `wc`) in the two SAM files in the `sam` directory

```{bash}

```

# Note that gzcat will decompress all files you give it and send the output to _stdout_.  Knowing this, count how many lines are in all the `R1` files in `fastq` (after decompressing them into text files), and also count up all the lines in the `R1` files in `fastq`.  Note they should be the same.

```{bash}

```

# Now, gzcat all the `R1` files in `fastq` and redirect that to a file called `R1_all_via_gzcat.fq` in the top directory of the repo

```{bash}

```

# People are usually familiar with using `cat` to catenate text files.  It turns out that you can also catenate `gzip` compressed files.  The result is another properly gzipped file that can be decompressed.  Catenate all the gzipped `R1` files in `fastq` into a single (still gzipped) file called `R1_all_via_cat.fq.gz`

```{bash}

```

# Copy `R1_all_via_cat.fq.gz` to `copy_of_R1_all_via_cat.fq.gz`

```{bash}

```

# Now, decompress `R1_all_via_cat.fq.gz` into `R1_all_via_cat.fq`

```{bash}

```

# Compute the SHA1 hashes of `R1_all_via_cat.fq` and `R1_all_via_gzcat.fq` to confirm they are identical

```{bash}

```

# But now, gzip `R1_all_via_gzcat.fq` and compare the result to `copy_of_R1_all_via_cat.fq.gz` by computing the SHA1 hash of each

```{bash}

```

Note that this shows that, although the compressed files are not identical, their contents (once decompressed, are identical).

# using `du` with the `-h` (i.e. "human readable" option) print the file sizes of `R1_all_via_cat.fq` and `copy_of_R1_all_via_cat.fq.gz`.

```{bash}

```

# By what factor (approximately) does the compression save storage space on your disk?

```

```

# Remove all files starting with `R1_all` and `copy_of_R1`

```{bash}

```

# Now, print the file sizes (with `du -h`, again) of the files in `bam` to the files in `sam`

```{bash}

```


# Print the last 15 lines of `sam/DPCh_plate1_A05_S5.sam` to _stdout_

```{bash}

```

If it all looks like gibberish to you, despair not!  You will be super familiar with
this file format within a couple of weeks from now.


# Print the _first_ 15 lines of `sam/DPCh_plate1_A05_S5.sam` to _stdout_

```{bash}

```

# Catenate the file `count_files.sh` to _stdout_

```{bash}

```

# Note that `count_files.sh` is a short shell script. Try to execute it with `./count_files.sh`

```{bash}

```

Aha! You should have gotten a permission denied error.  99% of the time that occurs because
the file is not user-executable.

# List (long) `count_files.sh` to see what the permissions are, and then add execute (`x`) permissions to users and groups with the "add-or-subtract permissions syntax" of `chmod`, then long list it again

```{bash}

```




# Use chmod to change permissions of the files in the `silly` directory to match their names. For example for the first one you would use: `chmod 770 FILE-rwxrwx---`.  Use the octal specifiers to `chmod`. Do this for all 5 files (one chmod command for each), and at the end do `ls -l silly` to verify they are correct.

```{bash}

```
